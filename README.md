# Bocce-Ball
a personal hobby and learning javascript

This is a personal side project that I thought of before I started bootcamp.  After we coded a game of "rock, paper, scissors" I became even more interested in coding my idea utilizing everything we learn in class.  The goal is to take bocce ball, which essentially is a simple game of measuring the distance between two points with the win condition being triggered by answering "whose closer to the pallino?" I would like to apply the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and everything else we learn in class to automating and tracking data (i.e. the measurement of distance between two points, the application of the rules & scoring and building an app that is intuitive for players to use.  This assumes that we, the programmers, already have access to the positioning of the balls on the court (through a transmitter or radar, etc.)  to store & analyze the data from the game for each player for each of their throws.
